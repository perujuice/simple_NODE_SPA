# A3 SPA

The application is an SPA that acts as a **Personal Web Desktop** with 3 applications that can be opened by clicking on the icons on the bottom footer. Each app can be opened and interacted with separately. The apps provided include a memory game, a web socket chat application and a quiz game. Below is an example screenshot of the PWD at runtime with several application windows open.

# Memory Game
- The user can open and play multiple memory games simultanously
- The user can play the memory game using only the keyboard
- Extended feature: The gameboard is resizable and has a timer for each instance as well as counting the number of attempts per instance for the user to engage with it in a competative way!

# Chat App
- Extended features: Change username between instances in the same PWD and time stamp for each message!
- emoji support has been implemented
- Added support for code, works also for inline code in a single message with regular text!
